# Install CHIRP

CHIRP supports the UV-K6 out of the box. If you want to use CHIRP with the *armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom* firmware you need to install a custom script in CHIRP first. This script gives you the ability to directly configure the radio for the changes that the firmware implements. Here are quick links for how to install CHRIP:
